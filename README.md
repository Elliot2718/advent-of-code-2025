# Advent of Code 2025
by Elliot and the kiddos

In 2025, I decided to try doing Advent of Code with my older three kids, at the time ages 13, 11, and 9. I'm writing this after day 2, and so far it's been fun! We've successfully worked through the first part of each day together, although I ended up needing to finish off the second part by myself.

My self-imposed guidelines for this effort were:
- Aim for having fun with my kids
- Try to make the code understandable by my kids
- No AI help allowed (except for looking up Python syntax)
- No refactoring the code after getting the right answer (aka it's ok if it's messy)
